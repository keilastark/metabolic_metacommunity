This repository provides code for the manuscript "A temperature-dependent metacommunity framework for understanding biodiversity change with warming". It is adapted from code made by Patrick L. Thompson (https://github.com/plthompson/Meta_com_framework/)

The workflow can be replicated as follows:

1. Run generate_landscapes.R
2. Run the simulation code (
3. Run convert_julia_to_R.R
4. Run process_julia_outputs.R
5. Run generate_figures.R
